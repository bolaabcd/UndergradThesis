If we have a unobservable bow between $X$ and $Y$, and no variable mediating, only the direct influence of $X$ on $Y$, then we can't estimate the effect of interventions on $X$, not even if this is in a bigger graph. 

This happens for instance, if the clinical experiment of a drug is randomized but who accepts is not.

Removing edges and adding mediator can never worsen the identifiability of causal effects. 

Pearl shows examples of models in which the effect of $X$ on $Y$ is or is not identifiable and discusses them. I'll not focus much on that, but it seems like it's possible to learn how to compute $P(y|do(x))$ or if it's not possible by using the information here. If I understood correctly, there is currently no mechanical method of computing this automatically.

The idea is to identify interventional distributions.

Seems like this paper of 2013 shows exactly if it's possible to estimate the causal effects of interventions: \q{An Information Theoretic Measure of Judea Pearl's Identifiability and Causal Influence}.

Also, local identifiability is neither necessary nor sufficient for global identifiability.

I passed very quickly through this, but it specifies how to estimate effects of interventions given a graph.
