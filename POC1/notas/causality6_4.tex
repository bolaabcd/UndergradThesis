Stable Unbiasedness is when $P(y|do(x)) = P(y|x)$ in a stable way, even if small changes happenned. This is in the same sense as the stable distributions generated by a causal model or class of models, the unbiasedness is stable if it happens for all possible parametrizations of the models, in all possible models in our class of models.
