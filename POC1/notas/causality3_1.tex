The focus of this chapter is going to be to formalize qualitative assumptions about the causal structure and their consequences. The goal is to derive causal inferences from the combination of \textit{data}, \textit{qualitative assumptions} and \textit{experiments}.

We'll be able to determine if we have enough information to infer the results of an intervention, if we do  determine these results and if not determine what experiments and observations we might need to get that.
