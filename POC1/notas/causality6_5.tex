This is about collapsibility (another notion that people thought was related to counfounding in the past) and how it's really associated with counfounding.

It's related to the relation between the expected value of a conditional probability (the expectation varying on the variable we use to condition) and the value of another probability.

But again, Pearl procceeds to show the problems in this approach.

I get the feeling, again, that this is more to convince the people that are'nt convinced of the advantages of Pearl's new approach and still want to use previous ones.
