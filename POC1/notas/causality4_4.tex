This seems rather specific. It's about the specific situation in which we take different actions at different times and want to know the effect on $Y$. For unconditional plans, if we pre-define what we will do at the different times.

I'm skipping this. Maybe I should not, the results here are used in the next section...

One quick note: $P(y|do(x1),do(x2),do(x3),...,do(x_n))$ é a chance de $Y=y$ se tomar a ação de setar $x_1$, DEPOIS a de setar $x_2$, etc., nessa ordem!
