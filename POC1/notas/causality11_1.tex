Pearl argues that the distinction between causal and statistical phenomena is clear from the fact we can't do causal claims without extra causal assumptions, looking only at the joint distributions.

He also says that the distinction is usefull so people don't waste time trying to do impossible things.

If we condition on the descendent of a collider, then we also unblock the path.

An unblocked path is siply a collider-free path, or with colliders that have them or children conditioned.
