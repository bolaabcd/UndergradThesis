\textbf{Imperfect Compliance} is when, for instance, the subject might decide to reduce or increase the dosage depending on the reactions.

Sometimes we can't have a control group, for instance in AIDs research, forcing someone to take a placebo might kill them.

Some people might not take the experiment just by knowing it's randomized.

There's the idea of considering the effect of the intent to treat instead of the effect of treatment. This is problematic, as it might show that the intent to treat is beneficial when maybe the people that recovered are the ones that dropped the treatment, for instance.
