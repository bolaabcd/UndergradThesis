\subsection{Machine Learning}

Machine Learning is the field of study that focuses on developing methods of learning patterns from data in a way that generalizes to situations not present in the data. In recent years, significative advances have been observed in Machine Learning research, and also the popularity and applications of some methods increased significantly. One example is the improvement of Neural Network Architectures\cite{?}, and the popularity of Generative Models\cite{?}. Also, some recent research is focused on the theory behind such machine learning methods\cite{livros de SAAMAP}, and statistical learning in general \cite{VladmirNaumovichVapnik}. Part of the goal of the formalization of such theory is to provide more qualitative guarantees, for instance, in regard not only to accuracy, but also fairness, privacy and interpretability. We discuss these different goals in the next four subsections.
